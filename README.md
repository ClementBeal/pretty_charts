It's still in progress. I'm trying to draw the charts that are not provided by the other packages first. Then I'll add the interaction. 
The API might change because it's currently experiments.

# Pretty Charts

Pretty Charts is a chart library that aims to provide to the Flutter community charts like Matplotlib or Plotly.

Working on Android, iOS, Web, Desktop

## Demo

[Demo](https://pretty-charts.pages.dev/)

Or clone the project and run the example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ClementBeal/pretty_charts.git
cd pretty_charts/
cd example
flutter run
```

[!CAUTION]
There's a bug with Firefox making the rendering very slow. Use the demo with a Chromium-based browser instead.
